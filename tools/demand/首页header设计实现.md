## Copywriting Notes

1. **Tone = Warm expertise** – empathize with survival hurdles while promising clear solutions.
2. **Keyword Density** – “Winter Burrow,” “cozy survival,” “craft tools,” “keep warm” each appear once naturally to avoid keyword stuffing.
3. **Accessibility** – Add `aria-label` to buttons (e.g., `aria-label="Open 3-Minute Starter Guide"`).
4. **Alt Text** – Provide descriptive alt for each image (e.g., “Winter Burrow key art mouse with axe in snowy burrow”).
5. **Lighthouse SEO** – Place H1 before navigation for semantic correctness; preload hero image for < Largest Contentful Paint.

Implementing this header copy and asset set will deliver an immediate, trustworthy hook, guiding players straight to the resources that solve their biggest Winter Burrow frustrations while boosting search visibility.
