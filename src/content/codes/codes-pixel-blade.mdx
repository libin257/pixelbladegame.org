## ⚔️ Best Ways to Use Your Rewards

Players often waste boosts or gems by using them at the wrong time. Here’s how to maximize their value:

### ✔️ 1. Activate boosts before dungeon sessions  
XP and damage boosts stack well with long grinding sessions.

### ✔️ 2. Save Gems for banner weapons  
Avoid low-value purchases—gems are best spent on strong weapon pulls.

### ✔️ 3. Upgrade rings only after obtaining rare pieces  
Don’t waste enhancement materials on common rings.

### ✔️ 4. Combine buffs with potions  
For synergy tips, read **[How To Use Potions In Pixel Blade](/guides/how-to-use-potions-in-pixel-blade/)**.

### ✔️ 5. Check the weekly tier list  
Your rewards go further when invested in top-tier weapons.
