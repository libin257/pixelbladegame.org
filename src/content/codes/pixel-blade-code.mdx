## ⚔️ How to Use Code Rewards Efficiently

New players often waste bonus items by using them at the wrong time. Here’s how to maximize results:

### ✔️ 1. Use XP boosts before long dungeon runs  
Boosts stack with dungeon shrines for massive leveling gains.

### ✔️ 2. Save Gems for high-value weapon pulls  
Avoid spending gems on common items or rerolls.

### ✔️ 3. Upgrade rings after acquiring rare ones  
Don’t upgrade basic rings—wait for purple or gold rarity drops.

### ✔️ 4. Stack damage buffs before boss fights  
Bosses scale fast and buffs make a significant difference.

### ✔️ 5. Synergize potions and code boosts
