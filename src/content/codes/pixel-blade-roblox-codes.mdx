To get the most value from your redeemed rewards:

### ✔️ 1. Use XP boosts during dungeon grinding  
Boost multipliers + dungeon XP = fast leveling.

### ✔️ 2. Save gems for powerful weapon banners  
Don’t waste them on low-tier items.

### ✔️ 3. Only upgrade rare rings  
Avoid upgrading basic rings—wait for purple/gold rarity.

### ✔️ 4. Stack buffs before boss fights  
This dramatically improves DPS and survivability.

### ✔️ 5. Combine boosts with potions
