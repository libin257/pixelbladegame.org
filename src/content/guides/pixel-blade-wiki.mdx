## When Not to Rely Fully on the Wiki

Because the wiki is community-driven, it's not always instantly updated after hotfixes.

### Delays may occur in:
- Drop rate changes  
- Bug fixes  
- Early-event details  
- New weapon passives  
- Boss behavior adjustments  

For real-time accuracy, combine the wiki with Discord notifications and in-game patch notes.
