- **Location**: Different types of minerals are found in various locations. Be sure to explore multiple areas to collect a diverse range of resources.
- **Tools**: Equip yourself with the right tools. Upgrading your pickaxe will allow you to mine faster and obtain rarer resources.

## How to Optimize Your Mining Process

As you progress in the game, you’ll need to refine your mining approach. Here are some strategies to ensure you’re mining as efficiently as possible:

1. **Mining Patterns**: Many experienced miners recommend following certain patterns to ensure you cover as much ground as possible. Spiral or zigzag patterns tend to yield the best results.

3. **Focus on High-Value Resources**: Some resources, such as diamonds and rare ores, are more valuable and will provide better rewards when sold or used for crafting.

### Mining for Rare Resources

While common resources are easy to find, rare ones can be more difficult to locate. Here’s how to improve your chances of finding them:

- **Explore Deeper Levels**: Rare resources are often hidden deep within mines, requiring you to mine through layers of rock. The deeper you go, the better your chances.
- **Timing**: According to player feedback, certain rare resources are more abundant during specific times of the in-game day. Keep an eye on the in-game clock.
