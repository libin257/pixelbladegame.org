## 🎯 All Methods to Get Wishes in Pixel Blade

Below are the safest and most consistent ways to earn wishes in the game.

### 1. **Completing Dungeon Runs**
Wishes often drop as dungeon clear rewards—especially in higher-tier zones.  
The more challenging the dungeon, the higher the drop chance. Longer runs yield more loot rolls, which translates into more opportunities for wishes.

### 2. **Redeeming Codes**
Many redeem codes offer wishes as part of their reward pool.  
Try using codes from our dedicated guides such as:

- [Pixel Blade Codes](/codes/pixel-blade-codes/)  
- [Pixel Blade Codes 2025](/codes/pixel-blade-codes-2025/)  

Early-access codes, milestone codes, and event drops sometimes include guaranteed wish rewards.

### 3. **Daily Chests & Login Bonuses**
Pixel Blade frequently rewards players for logging in.  
Daily chests, weekly bonuses, and streak rewards may include wishes or items that lead to more wish drops.

### 4. **Special Events & Limited-Time Modes**
Seasonal or weekend events occasionally increase drop rates for rare resources, including wishes.  
As the wiki and the community suggest, events tied to major updates often boost your chances.

### 5. **Level Progression & Achievements**
Certain levels or achievement milestones may grant items or boosts that help indirectly generate more wishes during gameplay.

### 6. **Trading Duplicate Gear for Resources**
Some gear can be dismantled for materials that help you clear harder content faster.  
Higher dungeon clears → more loot → more wish chances.

## ⚙️ Best Farming Strategies for Wishes

Understanding **how to get wishes in Pixel Blade** is only half the story—farming efficiently is the real key.

### 📌 Optimize Your Build First
Before farming, check the [Pixel Blade Weapon Tier List](/tier-list/pixel-blade-weapon-tier-list/) to make sure you're using weapons that match your progression stage.

### 📌 Run Dungeons on Your Highest Beatable Tier
Don't run a dungeon simply because it's fast—run the highest tier you can reliably clear.

Higher tiers = more loot chances = more wishes.

### 📌 Combine XP Potions With Boost Events
Using potions just before event multipliers begins gives you a big loot surge over a short period.

### 📌 Focus on Boss-Specific Routes
Certain bosses tend to drop larger reward bundles.  
More bundles = more chances for wish drops.

### 📌 Avoid Low-Value Runs
Low-tier farming wastes time. Wishes don’t drop consistently in easy zones, so aim mid-to-high difficulty.

## 🧪 Should You Save or Spend Wishes?

Spending wishes early can help you progress faster, but saving them for event banners or future items might be smart depending on your strategy.

### When to Spend Wishes
- If you're stuck at a progression wall  
- When your weapon upgrades stall  
- During limited-time banners

### When to Save Wishes
- Before major updates  
- If you already have strong early-game weapons  
- When community leaks hint at upcoming items
