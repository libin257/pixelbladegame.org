# Winter Burrow UI Scaler Mod Installation Guide

Here’s a detailed guide on how to use the **UI Scaler Mod** for Winter Burrow. If you find the game’s interface too small on high‑resolution monitors, or too large on small screens, this mod will help scale the UI (user interface) to a comfortable size. We’ll explain what the mod does, why you might want it, how to install it step‑by‑step, and some troubleshooting tips.

## What is the UI Scaler Mod?

A “UI Scaler Mod” is a modification that adjusts the size, layout or scaling of the game’s UI elements (menus, icons, text, HUD) so they display well on different screen resolutions or display setups. In the context of Winter Burrow, the **Winter Burrow UI Scaler Mod** allows you to:

* Increase or decrease the size of interface elements (inventory icons, text, dialog boxes)  
* Adjust UI layout to avoid overlap or cut‑off on ultrawide or 4K monitors  
* Improve readability and usability if the default UI appears too small or too big on your display  
* Potentially lock a preferred UI scale or toggle between preset sizes  

If you’ve ever found that the in‑game fonts were tiny, or that on your big display the HUD looked awkwardly spaced, the UI Scaler Mod is specifically designed to fix that.

## Why Use the Winter Burrow UI Scaler Mod?

Here are some compelling reasons to install it:

1. **High‑Resolution Monitors**: On 4K or ultrawide monitors, many indie games default to UI scales that look very small — the default UI in Winter Burrow might feel too fine.  
2. **Small Screen/Streaming Setup**: Conversely, if you’re streaming the game or playing on a small windowed screen, the UI might be too large and feel cramped.  
3. **Accessibility**: Players who need larger text or icons for readability will benefit from scaling the UI.  
4. **Comfort & Immersion**: A well‑scaled UI keeps you immersed in the cozy world of Winter Burrow without being distracted by badly sized menus or overlays.  

It’s a simple tweak, but one that improves the experience significantly for many screen setups.

## Installation – Step by Step

Here’s how to install the **UI Scaler Mod** for Winter Burrow. Since mod‑installation procedures may vary slightly depending on the version, always check the mod’s description for version compatibility. The example link for one such mod is: [UI Scaler Mod on Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/winterburrow/mods/2)  

### Step 1: Backup Your Game  
Before installing any mod, it’s wise to back up your game folder or at least any important save files. If something goes wrong, you can revert to the un‑modded version.

### Step 2: Download the Mod  
Go to the mod page (e.g., nexusmods.com/winterburrow/mods/2) and download the UI Scaler Mod package. Make note of the version and any prerequisites (e.g., “requires version x.x.x of Winter Burrow” or “requires mod loader Y”).

### Step 3: Locate Your Game Folder  
Find your Winter Burrow installation directory. If you’re using Steam on Windows, a common path is:  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Winter Burrow`

### Step 4: Install the Mod Files  
Inside the mod package you downloaded, you’ll typically see files like `UI_Scaler.dll`, `UI_ScalerConfig.json`, or a folder named `Mods/UI_Scaler`. Copy those files/folder into the game’s mod folder or root game folder, depending on the mod’s instructions.  
**Example**:  
- Create a folder: `...\Winter Burrow\Mods\UI_Scaler\`  
- Place `UI_Scaler.dll`, config files, and assets inside.

### Step 5: Configure the UI Scale  
Once installed, launch Winter Burrow. The mod may provide a configuration menu (in‑game) or you might edit a `config.json` file in the mod folder. Look for settings such as:  
```json
{
  "UIScale": 1.25,
  "HUDElements": true,
  "TextSizeMultiplier": 1.4
}
````

Modify `UIScale` (e.g., 1.0 = default, >1 = larger UI, <1 = smaller UI) to your preference. Save the config.

### Step 6: Launch & Test

Start the game and verify:

* Is the main menu readable and comfortable?
* In‑game HUD (health/warmth/hunger) icons scale properly?
* Inventory text and icons are clear and not cut off or overlapping?
* Dialog boxes and UI elements don’t extend off‑screen on your display?

If everything looks good, you’re set. If not, tweak the config again or revert the mod.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

* **Mod version mismatch**: If Winter Burrow receives an update and the mod hasn’t been updated, UI elements may misalign or crash. Check for mod updates.
* **Conflicts with other mods**: If you use multiple UI or layout mods, they may conflict. Try disabling other UI mods and test solely with UI Scaler.
* **Performance issues**: Rare for UI mods, but if you notice stuttering or UI lag, try lowering the scale or disabling other mods.
* **Windowed vs Full‑screen**: Some UI mods behave differently in windowed mode vs full‑screen. Test both if you switch display modes often.
* **Save backups**: Always keep a backup of your save files in case you want to revert to default UI behavior.

## Final Thoughts

The **Winter Burrow UI Scaler Mod** is a modest but highly effective enhancement for players who care about readability, comfort, and display fit. Whether you’re playing on a 32‑inch 4K monitor, a laptop, or streaming on a smaller window, getting the UI to “feel right” makes the cozy world of Winter Burrow much more comfortable.
