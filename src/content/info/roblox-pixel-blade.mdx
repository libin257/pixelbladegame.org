## Gameplay Breakdown: How Roblox Pixel Blade Works

The gameplay can be simplified into three systems: **weapons**, **rings**, and **dungeons**, all connected through progression loops.

### ⚔️ Weapons

### 💍 Rings
Rings provide passive bonuses to:
- ATK and Crit

Late-game players often rely on rings more than weapons for survivability.

### 🏰 Dungeons
Dungeons reward:
