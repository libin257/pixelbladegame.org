## 🟣 S-Tier Weapons (Best of the Best)

These weapons dominate almost every part of the game—dungeons, bosses, and speedruns.

### **1. Dragonblade**
- Extremely high burst damage  
- Wide slash arc for mob clearing

- Ideal for both early and late game  

### **2. Thunder Greatblade**
- Electric scaling benefits greatly from potion stacking  
- Massive AoE hitbox  
- Strongest option for mob waves  
- Requires some mastery due to slower swings  

### **3. Arcane Magicblade**

**Why S-Tier?**  
These weapons have no major weaknesses and outclass most other options in DPS or clearing efficiency.
